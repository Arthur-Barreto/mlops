# About this Course

We will learn how to **Take Machine Learning Models to Production**!

## Schedules

- **Monday**: 09:45
- **Wednesday**: 09:45
- Office hours on **xxx** xx:xx PM - xx:xx PM (Teams)

## Deliverables

Students will need to submit some assignments:

- `APS`: practical activities developed during and after classes.
- `INT`: some classes will focus on technical interviews in machine learning. These classes will require previous preparation by the students, who will interview each other during those classes.
- `PRO`: in the last classes, students will have to apply the knowledge acquired in a project involving the deploy of an ML model.

## Exams

The interview assignments (`INT`) are like exams. Besides that, there will be no exams, neither classes during the intermediate and final assessment week of Insper's calendar.

## Requirements.txt!

In order for you to absorb the most from the course activities, it is mandatory that you have knowledge in:

- Advanced computer programming
- Cloud computing
- Basic statistics

It's a good idea to have already taken the Insper courses:

- Cloud computing
- Machine Learning

## Final grade

The final grade is calculated with the following formula

```
NF = 0.35*APS + 0.30*INT + 0.35*PRO
```

Some conditions are required for approval:

- Grade average greater than or equal to `5.0` in **APS**, **INT** and **PRO**.
- A maximum of two assignments (interviews + APS) with a score of zero or not submitted.

If any of these criteria is not met, the student will fail this course!
